# Portfolio_JMJ


First Portfolio - Jessica Justmann


Deployment Link: https://mjjust31.github.io/Portfolio_JMJ/


Project Scope: Working with HTML and CSS together to create a first portfolio for futher work. 


*For the boxes, I used Display: Grid as many of the same size boxes were used to create the amount of columns and rows. Still working out the grid work and placement for CSS. Working on positioning within the display:grid as I was trying to make it work within the nesting feature of the container for the span over to the column rows. I think what I should have done was make the grid 3x3 and have the first box span over the row as well and not just the column for sizing. 


Support: 
- I was having an issue with committing the process of the code to GitHub. I attended office hours on May 16th in the morning to help commit to the repo by also creating a new repo- which is why you see a limited number of commits on this project.
