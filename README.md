# Portfolio_JMJ


First Portfolio - Jessica Justmann


Deployment Link: https://mjjust31.github.io/Portfolio_JMJ/


Project Scope: Working with HTML and CSS together to create a first portfolio for futher work. 


*For the boxes, I used Display: Grid as many of the same size boxes were used to create the amount of columns and rows. Still working out the grid work and placement for CSS. Working on positioning within the display:grid. 





Support: 
- I was having an issue with committing the process of the code to GitHub. I attended office hours on May 16th in the morning to help commit to the repo - which is why you see a limited number of commits on this project.
