First Portfolio


*Special note. I was having an issue with committing the process of the code to GitHub. I attended office hours on May 16th in the morning to help commit to the repo - which is why you see a limited number of commits on this project.

.Container: I decided to try using the CSS Grid style because I noticed on the mock-up that the shapes were the same and follows a box layout. I watched a supplemental video to learn about fr (fraction of the viewport). To start, I made the container have two columns and three template rows. I sized the conatiner to what the mockup looked like (and specifically into 6 boxes).From their, I sized using the "fr" of the page to determine the container layout. 
     #nested_box: From what I could see in one of the container's boxes, there was a further breakdown 

Images: I am not totally sure why the images are not loading. I will have to investigate this at a later time. I am unable to determine if I am going to have a sizing issue with the images. 



I am not sure where the break it is where I am trying to load the image.
